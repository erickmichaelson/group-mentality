I deal with stress and anxiety on a daily basis, but I'm feeling especially stressed out at work lately becuase of the workload I'm expected to complete very soon. I'm a software engineer at Random Tech Company, and since it's a good gig, I'm really concerned that if I mention how anxious the job is right now, I might get fired. Am I overthinking this? What should I do?",
